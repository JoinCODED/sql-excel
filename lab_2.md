# Lab | SQL - Aggregation

## üßæ Introduction
In this lab, we are adding the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to our SQL vocabulary.

# üîç Challenge Questions

Assume that any `ID` columns are incremental, meaning that higher IDs always occurred after lower ones. For example, a customer with a higher `CustomerID` joined the bank after one with a lower `CustomerID`.
